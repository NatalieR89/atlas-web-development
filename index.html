    <div class="wow">
        <h1>World of Warcraft</h1>
        <p> I am an avid World of Warcraft (WoW) player, with over a dacade of experience! When I'm not working on school work it takes most of my free time. 
           I mainly play WoW to farm mounts and transmog gear so that I can style my character to fit my personality.
           I also do raid content with a group of 10 to 30 players with the goal of killing an endgame boss.
           My brother got me into the game as a way for him and I to "hang out" while he was deployed overseas in the United States Navy.
