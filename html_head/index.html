    <!--World Of Warcraft-->
    <div class="wow">
        <h1>World of Warcraft</h1>
        <p> I am an avid World of Warcraft (WoW) player, with over a decade of experience! When I'm not working on school work it takes most of my free time. 
           I mainly play WoW to farm mounts and transmog gear so that I can style my character to fit my personality.
           I also do raid content with a group of 10 to 30 players with the goal of killing an endgame boss.
           My brother got me into the game as a way for him and I to "hang out" while he was deployed overseas in the United States Navy.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!--Fun Facts-->
    <div class="fun">
        <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
        <p>I don't have a lot of fun facts about myself, but I'll try my best here. I bought 1988 Chevrolet bus last summer. I'm currently living on and renovating at the same time.
           I've never wanted to be tied down to a permanent residence like a brick and mortor home or apartment. Plus the bus is already paid off and the renovations are slowly getting done.</p><br>
        <p>I want to have the style of a 50s housewife. The dresses and heels of that era are amazing! And not to mention that I'd always be ready for a cocktail party!!!</p>
    </div>

    <!--Why I Chose Atlas-->
    <div class="why">
       <h1>Why I Chose To Attend Atlas</h1>
       <p>I have always had an interest in coding in general but didn't have a clue where to begin. Atlas offered and opportunity that would have been out of reach otherwise.
        Having come to Atlas, I feel it has given me a better understanding of how code works and has helped me begin to think more logically, especially on personal projects. 
       </p>
    </div>

    <!--Future Plans-->
    <div class="future">
        <h1>Future Plans</h1>
        <p>The future is an unknown and hard for me to plan by. The best I can do is make a list of goals that don't have an expiration date. 
           Some goals are to Stay around the Tulsa area, get a WFH job, after completeing Atlas, I would love to spend some time in the Florida Keys
           and the to the mountains as far from society as possible.</p>
